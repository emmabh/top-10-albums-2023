# Emma's Top 10 Albums 2023

I made a zine/card thingy to commemorate my top 10 albums of the year! It works like one of those singing birthday cards, playing bleepy bloopy snippets from each album when the card is opened. A light blinks to tell you when to turn a wheel, revealing the next album in the countdown.
Risograph printed with [secret riso club](https://secretrisoclub.com/) and hand assembled/programmed by meeeee!

## for u geeks
I hand charted out each song in MuseScore, and then used this [AMAZING godsend of a tool](https://extramaster.net/tools/midiToArduino/) to convert to frequencies passed to a piezo buzzer in Arduino code.

used a reed switch and magnet for card opening/closing trigger mechanism!

Used Arduino to program an ATTiny85 to play each song and blink the lil LED.

Card designed in Photoshop/Illustrator.
